# NOSBE712

This is an environment for the [DtCyber Emulator](https://github.com/kej715/DtCyber) to build and run an NOS/BE Level 712 operating system.

Main application of this environment is the autojob.js program which allows
series of batch jobs and their tape requests running automatically.

See [How to build NOS/BE 1.5 Level 712 from Scratch](https://cdc.sjzoppi.com/doku.php?id=nosbe:building_nos_be_level_712_from_scratch) for further information.
