/*
 * This autojob configuration configures and builds  a minimum configured 
 * system (user library method) which can be used to build the *full* system
 *
 * This takes about 2h on a Raspberry Pi4 (Debian 64bit)
 * After successful completion you can run the jobs to build the deadstart tape
 * with the command ./autojob.js build_dstape_mini
 *
 * The NOS/BE configuration happens mainly in the PL1A job.
