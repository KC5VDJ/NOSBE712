/*
 * This autojob configuration configures and builds the following products
 * (user library method):
 * - NOS/BE, FTN, FTN5, SYMPL, BAM, AAM, CCL, PMD, SORT5, CID, Intercom 5
 * - 8-Bit Library, FORM, Fortran 4/5 conversion utility, BASIC
 * - M77, Pascal 6000
 * The following products are extracted from the TUB deadstart tape:
 * - MNF, Algol5, Algol68, PL/1
 *
 * This takes about 6h on a Raspberry Pi4 (Debian 64bit)
 * After successful completion you can run the jobs to build the deadstart tape
 *
 * The NOS/BE configuration happens mainly in the PL1A job.
 *
 * Note: SORT/MERGE builds successfuly but does not run at the moment
