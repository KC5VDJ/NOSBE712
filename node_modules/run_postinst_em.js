/*
 * Run this autojob config after the first level 0 deadstart of your
 * configured NOS/BE712 system (with EM)
 *
 * The Intercom configuration in job TDFGEN provides a single connection
 * to NOS/BE on TCP/IP port 5000 via RDF.
 * (Thx to Ned Deily)
 *
 * Warning: RDF must not be active while job TDFGEN is running. Otherwise the job
 *          will fail without notice
 * 
 * Note:    The changes to the terminal definition file  and the Intercom
 *          password file each require an operator authorization j.GO on DSD.
 *
 * The other jobs restore permanent files from the build system, which are
 * required in the production system.
 * A system bulletin file is initialized.
