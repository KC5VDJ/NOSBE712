/*
 * Run this job config after the first level 0 deadstart of your
 * configured system.
 *
 * The Intercom configuration in job TDFGEN provides a single connection
 * to NOS/BE on TCP/IP port 5000 with username TEST1 and password TEST via RDF.
 * (Thx to Ned Deily)
 *
 * Warning: RDF must not be active while job TDFGEN is running. Otherwise the job
 *          will fail without notice
 * 
 * Note:    The changes to the terminal definition file  and the Intercom
 *          password file require an operator authorization j.GO on DSD.
 *
 * The other jobs restore some files from the build system:
 * - JOBS oldpl
 * - COMPCOM 
 * - COMCPL
