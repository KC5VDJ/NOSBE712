/*
 * Run this autojob config after the first level 0 deadstart of your
 * configured NOS/BE712 system (no EM)
 *
 * The first job TDFGEN configures Intercom. It provides a single connection
 * to NOS/BE on TCP/IP port 5000 via RDF (Thx to Ned Deily)
 *
 * Note:    Job TDFGEN requires operator action!
 *          The changes to the terminal definition file  and the Intercom
 *          password file each require an operator authorization j.GO on DSD.
 *
 * Warning: RDF must not be active while job TDFGEN is running. Otherwise the job
 *          will fail without notice
 *
 * Job DUM creates the DUM file which is needed for DUMPF/LOADPF.
 * The MD,CN,EX and RD passewords are set to "XYZ".
 *
 * Job RESTOR resores files from the full PF dump of the build system. The files
 * DECKS, COMPCOM, COMCPL, INTLIB and the Pascal 6000 utilities are restored
 *
 * Job SYSBULL creates a system bulletin file. It has a short welcome message
 * for Intercom. The batch system bulletin message is disabled.
 *
 * JOB PL73 builds the DCL2 binaries.
 *
